                    A well-organized piece of writing is not only clear but also logical and aesthetic. Existence
                    of organizational markers and coherent flow of ideas are typically the focus in evaluation of
                    writing. It is also important to know the parts of the paragraph to help you form the framework of
                    your composition. There are four fundamental properties of a well-written text; organization,
                    coherence and cohesion, language use, and mechanics.

                    Organization, also known as an arrangement, refers to the structural framework for
                    writing. It is achieved when ideas are logically and accurately arranged with focus on the
                    arrangement of ideas, incidents, evidence, or details in a definite order in a paragraph, essay, or
                    speech. Organization can be achieved through the following techniques: unity in the text
                    structure, coherence and cohesion, and physical format.

                    <li>
                        Unity is achieved when a composition is focused on one idea. In a unified text, all
                        supporting ideas are relevant to the main thought.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coherence and cohesion are two basic features that facilitate textual continuity. The two terms are connected but cannot be used interchangeably.

                    <li>
                        Physical Format. Another aspect of the organization that is immediately apparent to the
                        reader is the format. It is observed in how the text physically appears like headings and
                        subheadings, bullet points, or font emphasis.

                    <li>
                        <b>Sequential Order</b>. It is a technique in arranging the text observing the chronological   order or
                        time, process or sequence, and narration of events by using signal words like first, second,
                        third, initially, primarily, following, preceding, next, when, later, before, after, then, until, not
                        long after that, finally, lastly, at last, etc.

                        <b>Spatial Order.</b> This is another technique in organizing the paragraph pertaining to space,
                        position, or location of people or things by using signal words like above, below, under, behind,
                        beside, beyond, alongside, nearby, in front of, inside, outside, on top of, etc. This is very
                        suitable when describing about the geographical location of things or people.

                    <li>
                        <b>Complexity Order.</b> This technique in organizing compositions refers to the logical order from
                        simple to complex, inductive to deductive, cause and effect, and problem and solution to help
                        the writers explain their ideas. This can also be done by defining and illustrating. For cause-
                        effect, you can use signal words like for, because, since, as a consequence, due to, etc. Signal

                        words like because, as a solution, consequently, so that, therefore, etc. can be used for problem-

                        solution. When defining, transitional devices such as is defined as, means, refers to, to
                        illustrate, as defined, etc. can be used.

                       <b> Listing Order.</b> It means the ordering of ideas following the alphabet (from A to Z). Examples

                        Oro City, Caloocan, Cebu, Davao City, Manila, Parañaque, Pasig, Quezon City, Taguig, and
                        Zamboanga City. This can also be done by enumerating ideas through numbers in ascending
                        order (e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, etc.) and descending order (e.g. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2, and 1).

                                    <b>Thesis Statement</b> is the central idea of a multiple-paragraph composition. It can be a one-sentence or two summary that guides, controls , and unifies ideas when writing. In simple terms, all other udeas present in an essay revolve around the thesis statement.

In short, this provides further explanation in support to your introduction, particularly your thesis statement. The organization of the middle of a piece of writing depends on the genre. Researchers have identified five basic organizational structures: sequence, description, cause and effect, compare and contrast, and problem and solution.

                                mini-thesis statment of a paragraph which contains a main point that supports the thesis
                                statement. The topic sentence can be found anywhere in the paragraph: in the beginning,
                                at the end, or in the middle. If it is found at the end of the paragraph, it may be used as a
                                clinching or concluding sentence.

                                restatement of the topic sentence, a summary, or a conclusion based on the supporting
                                details.” Connecting the topic sentence and supporting details alone will not make a united
                                paragraph. These parts must also coincide with the closing sentence which will determine
                                the reader’s understanding of the paragraph.

                            footsteps from miles away from where the snow leopard is located. Did you know that
                            a snow leopard‟s tail helps keep it from falling? The long tail helps it to balance.
                            Finally, the fur on a snow leopard‟s body helps it stay warm in this frigid habitat.

                    Cohesion can be applied using four techniques. The first one is through the use of
                    transitional devices to connect sentences with linked ideas. The second technique is through the
                    use of pronouns to refrain from using a specific word repeatedly. The third technique employs a
                    repetition of keywords to tie up the paragraphs subtly. The lasT technique is using synonyms.

                            If text structures serve as the framework, signal words are textual cues that readers use to
                            follow a text. They can signal the transition from one point to another, the ordering of events
                            and concepts, or the writer’s chosen text type.

                    _____Dragonflies are not only beautiful insects, but they are also protectors of human beings, as
                    a walk in the marsh taught me.
                    <br />
                    _____As I left the marsh, I realized that my rescuers, the dragonflies, had lifted deerflies from my
                    hair, skin and clothing, saving me from more bites.
                    <br />
                    _____That night, after I arrived home from my walk, I understood that dragonflies had taught me
                    to keep an open mind about insects.
                    <br />
                    _____Soon after the first bite, painful welts formed on my skin, itching and stinging intensely.
                    <br />
                    _____Because deerfly bites are much more painful than mosquito bites, I moved quickly through
                    the marsh, trying to prevent the first bite of the deerflies which were pursuing me.
                    <br />
                    _____When I first entered the open marsh, aggressive deerflies began to circle and swarm around
                    me.
                    <br />
                    _____Since they devour deerflies as part of their diet, the lovely dragonflies were attracted to the
                    deerflies on my skin and clothing and came so close that they brushed me with their multicolored,
                    transparent wings.
                    <br />
                    _____Then, clouds of big, beautiful dragonflies suddenly appeared, shimmering like rainbows.
                    <br />
                    _____One day in July, unaware that deerflies were in season, I decided to take a walk in the marsh
                    in northern Michigan.

                    First, the floodwater must be controlled to keep streets clear, but water pumps cannot
                    always access them. Flood creates problems for homeowners. So, many communities leave the
                    expense of clearing floods up to the homeowners; and some homeowners cannot afford the
                    expense of really cleaning up their areas. Always potentially hazardous, water can damage houses
                    and endanger those who live in them. Moreover, water may seem harmless, yet it is not.<br /><br />

                    Prejudice is the concept which, as far back in the 13th century, describes any of the

                    irrational behavior or attitude towards a person; hostility directed against a person, a group, a race,
                    or any characteristics associated with them. Prejudice is also related to certain –isms that reveal
                    how systematic and organized its application can be. These are regionalism and nationalism, which
                    are not bad in themselves, but which often trigger (2)__________ on the part of those who, as an
                    expression of their identity or cultural membership, seem to regard all others as being less,

                    just be the point of his discussion: Confronted with the kind of thinking and point of view that
                    imitates their own, prejudiced readers can’t help but agree. __________ (5). What Hollingshead
                    wants to achieve is not without its own __________ (6); sometimes, the best way to understand a
                    point is, precisely, to ) misunderstand it. In other words, reading and resistance do not have to be
                    __________ (7).

                    than an admission that democracy has failed in its highest ideal: __________ (11). Hollingshead’s

                    it still ignores the fact that certain social realities as well as individuals, for the most part, are
