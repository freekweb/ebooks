                    In this unit, language use refers to the grammar rules. Grammar is the core structure of a
                    language. It is composed of rules that govern how words can be put together to form sentences.
                    Proper grammar is necessary for credibility, readability, communication, and clarity.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Mastering grammar will allow you as a writer to make your work clearer and more
                    readable. Furthermore, using proper grammar leads you to understanding the meaning and the
                    message of your sentences and paragraphs more acurately. Otherwise, meaning can be changed or
                    lost.

                            A phrase or a clause is described as dangling, hanging or misrelated when it is
                            inappropriately attached to a word or when it is not related structurally to any part of the
                            sentence. The effects of such phrases and clauses may be confusing and misleading. Dangling
                            modifiers do not sensibly modify anything in their sentences. These modifiers occur most often
                            when certain kinds of modifying word groups precede the main clause of the sentence.

                                capable of driving. The sentence says that the bears are driving, but common sense tells us bears can’t drive. Although the writer surely meant that the bears were seen by some person
                                who was driving, the sentence contains no words directly identifying such a person.
