                    Good Job! Finally, you are on the final convention in writing which is mechanics. Are you
                    a type of person who is conscious of your spelling, punctuation marks, and capitalization? If yes,
                    then continue developing that skill. Well if not, it is your time to be reminded and be conscious
                    about your spelling, punctuation marks, abbreviation, indention, and capitalization.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    The goal of mechanics of writing is to make the writing precise and grammatically correct.
                    It is directed to make the writing systematic in terms of correct spelling, punctuation, italics and
                    so on. The mechanics of writing are the rules that must be followed because if one fails to do so,
                    or if there are no such rules of writing, then the writing would be certainly very difficult.

                        These are critical factors in written language, which can either clarify the meaning or confuse the reader. Written communication must be more precise and accurate to convey the
                        intended meaning. Hence,writing mechanics standardize how written language is presented to
                        clarify the writer's intent and content.

                            Punctuation is important as it replaces the emotions conveyed by facial expressions, tone

                                    <b>Exclamation</b> marks are one of the few tools in writing mechanics that help the writer express emotion. They are written at the termination of a sentence to express strong emotions such as surprise, anger, or excitement.

                                    <b>Questions</b> are usually indicated by intonation in spoken communication. Sometimes

                                    the speaker is asking a question.

                </h6>
                <p id="about">
                    Capitalization (American English) or capitalisation (British English) is writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter (uppercase letter) and the remaining letters in lower case, in writing systems with a case distinction. The term also may refer to the choice of the casing applied to text.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Generally, capitalization shows the beginning of a new sentence, which enables the words
                    to make sense. A capital letter with a full stop tells the reader to take a breath. To signify
                    uniqueness, proper nouns are capitalized. However, using capitalization merely to make a word
                    appear or sound significant is not right.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Some words, known as capitonyms, are two words that are the same, but their meaning
                    differs because one has a capital letter. Here are some examples:
                    <ol>
                        <li id="alpha">
                            China (country) and china (porcelain)

                        <li id="alpha">
                            March (month) and march (walking)
                        </li>
                        <li id="alpha">
                            August (month or a name) and august (adjective)
                        </li>

                </h6>
                <p id="about">
                    Capitalization allows our eye to automatically screen for important information
                    such as subject and location. Capitalization makes a difference in meaning by indicating
                    proper nouns.

                    Spelling is important for written communication. It is the basic tool for combining letters
                    to make words that have meaning. Having the ability to spell allows a person to communicate
                    through writing.

                <p id="about">
                    Poor spelling skills severely hamper a writer’s ability to communicate effectively in a
                    written format. One only has to consider the trials suffered by people with dyslexia to understand
                    why spelling is such a critical element in writing.

                    When it comes to spelling, accuracy is crucial. Spelling errors can confuse readers and
                    obscure a piece’s intended message. Incorrect spelling can also be seen as unprofessional, so you
                    must ensure that all spelling is correct throughout your work.

                    When you write, always make sure that you are consistently using one standard regarding
                    the spelling of your words. Remember that there are slight differences in American English
                    spelling and British English spelling.

                </h6>
                <p id="about">
                    You always need a pair of "fresh eyes" to look at your work. After la boring for so long
                    and just trying to write a good paper, you will no longer be able to spot lapses in your work. Thus,
                    you need an editor.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Here are some helpful tips to remember when you look for an editor of your work:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Find an honest and brutally frank editor. Your work will not improve if you want an editor
                        who will only praise you. A rough draft—even a revised draft-is a work in progress, so find
                        someone who will really tell you what's wrong or what's lacking.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Find a grammar expert. While it's close to impossible to find the perfect grammarian, one who has a very good grasp of the rules will be a good choice for an editor.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Find someone who will ask you questions about your work. Being asked about your work
                        forces you to see the reader's perspective. It is best to show your work to an expert in the topic
                        and then to a language/grammar expert.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        There are occasions when you will become the editor. It can be a daunting task. Some may even ask "Why me?" However, if you will indeed become an editor, do not forget these:
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Have your grammar book ready. You cannot possibly remember all the rules, especially if you are a beginning editor, so have your reference material ready. Websites will also help you.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        When in doubt, ask. If you cannot understand what the writer is trying to say, ask! It will be
                        dangerous for you to simply correct the grammatical aspect, yet miss out on the original
                        message.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Genuinely try to help. As an editor, you are there to help improve the work. Try your best to
                        save the work, since this is still a product of effort, hard work, and creativity. Place constructive
                        criticisms, suggest improvements, and provide insights.
                    </li>
                    <li id="numeric">
                        Edit your own corrections. Once you are finished editing the draft, read the whole thing again,
                        this time with your corrections. This will help you see if you too placed the correct marks.
