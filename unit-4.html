                    In writing, diction is the strategic choice of words based on the audience, context, or
                    situation. It can also express additional meanings or particular styles. The words you would choose
                    in an email to your teacher or work colleague are different from the words you’d choose when
                    speaking to a close friend or a relative. The difference lies on diction.

                    Diction is the careful selection of words to communicate a message or establish a particular
                    voice or writing style. For example, flowy, figurative language creates colorful prose, while a more
                    formal vocabulary with concise and direct language can help drive home a point.

                <p id="about">
                    Writers pick explicit words and expressions relying upon the result they're attempting to
                    accomplish. The motivation behind a bit of composing decides its expression. In writing, authors

                    regularly utilize casual lingual authority and interesting expressions or words utilized for non-
                    exacting implications, similar to comparisons and analogies. Hence, diction comes in through the

                    words usage if it is specialized, succinct, and formal, composed for a particular audience.

                            freedom to depict more realistic characters. Most of the short stories and novels use informal
                            diction to make it easier to understand by anyone especially if the target audience is anyone.

                            Slang is very informal language or specific words used by a particular group of people.
                            You'll usually hear slang spoken more often than you'll see it put in writing, though emails and
                            texts often contain many conversational slang words.

                            Poetic diction is driven by melodious words that identify with a particular subject reflected
                            in a sonnet, and make a musical, or agreeable, sound. It generally includes the utilization of
                            elucidating language, in some cases set to a beat or rhyme.

                        In a spoken communication, conversational participants can immediately ask for and give
                        clarification. However, in written communication, writers have only but one chance to
                        communicate their message. Hence, they must choose the most appropriate word.

                            <i>The following sentences show the change in meaning by changing one word:</i>

                            <p id="about">The man strolled across the street.</p>

                                importantly. If this were an eyewitness account of a road accident, the verb chosen would
                                provide critical information that may affect the outcome of the investigation.

                        Additionally, the wrong choice of words can change the message intended to the listener or
                        reader. To avoid misinterpretation, use strong and exact verbs, specific color, and appropriate
                        use of adjectives and adverbs. (Aguila, Galan, & Wigley, 2017)

                    <b>TOPIC 4: USING CONNOTATION AND DENOTATION</b>
                </h6>
                <p id="about">
                    Another way of improving of understanding the different meanings that particular words
                    can have is through connotation and denotation. Words only make sense to us if we understand
                    what they mean. Two ways of describing the meaning of a word are called denotation and
                    connotation.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Denotation is the basic, precise, literal meaning of the word that can be found in a
                    dictionary. Connotation, meanwhile, is the positive, negative or neutral feelings, attitudes, ideas,
                    or associations with a word. These shades of meaning are affected by social overtones, emotional
                    meanings, or cultural implications.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    For example, the color "red" has many connotations: it can represent a joyous occasion
                    because it is very festive, or it can represent anger (as in the idiom "seeing red) or being called a
                    member of the "reds" has historical associations with leftist organizations.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    To illustrate the difference between denotation and connotation. compare the following
                    meanings of the words "father" and "daddy":
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    <b>Father</b>
                    <p id="about">Denotation: a male parent.</p>
                    <p id="about">Connotation: -association: positive</p>
                    <p id="about">-feelings: love and respect</p>
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    <b>Daddy</b>
                    <p id="about">Denotation: a male parent.</p>
                    <p id="about">Connotation: -association: positive</p>
                    <p id="about">-feelings: love, familiarity, childhood</p>
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    The denotations of "father" and "daddy" are synonymous because they both pertain to a
                    male parent. However, denotations do not reveal the individual responses of people to a word.
                    "Daddy" is more connotative than "father," even though they denote the same thing because many
                    children have fond memories of their fathers. Of course, this does not discount that each reader
                    has a different relationship with his or her father. Two words may have the same definition but can
                    have different emotional content.
