                Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet in 2006 after the General Assembly of the IAU, as it
                only met 2 out of the association's three requirements to qualify as a Planet (Library of
                Congress). The quarrel started when Caltech astronomy prof Mike Brown discovered an
                Asteroid bigger than Pluto in 2005 (Cain, 2012). The science community went wild! Brown's
                findings sparked a debate on whether this new planet, which he named eris, should be added
                to the roster of 9 Planets. The controversy prompted the International Astronomical Union
                to meet up and delineate what a 'planet' is. They came up with three requirements to classify
                a celestial body as a planet and removed the Planet Status of Pluto based on the new
                definition.

                    "Online games aren't just a diversion, but a unique way to meet other people. As millions of gamers
                    demonstrate, playing online is about friendship and cooperation, not just killing monsters. These
                    games are a viable social network because players focus on teamwork, form groups with
                    likeminded people and have romantic relationships with other players. Massively Multiplayer
                    Online Games (MMOGs) feature millions of players interacting in the same environment. The
                    games are social in nature as they allow players to band together and complete missions based on
                    a story line, or test their skills by fighting against each other. At the start of the game, the user
                    creates a fictional character, and customizes its physical appearance. Since many games involve
                    combat, players also outfit their characters with armor and weapons, as well as choose their
                    "profession." Many popular game titles like World of Warcraft and Everquest follow a fantasy
                    theme, so most professions have magical abilities like healing other players or raising undead
                    minions. While the process seems simple, players may spend hours agonizing over the perfect look
                    for their character, from their armor color to the type of skills to use in battle. Once their character
                    is created, the player is free to explore the vast, digital world and interact with other players;
                    however, they must pay on average $15 a month for game content. MMOG users are mostly male
                    – usually between the ages of 18-34 – although titles like World of Warcraft have a healthy
                    population of female players as well. With millions of layers, there are plenty of people to
                    adventure with."

                    With the increasing popularity of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
                    social networking sites (SNS) have become an integral part of our lives. One of these SNS in
                    Facebook, a popular site which has over one billion active users around the world. Generally, there
                    are two main functions of Facebook: for personal use and for educational purpose.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    People use Facebook for their personal use to communicate with their friends and relatives.
                    For example, if there are important events to celebrate, a Facebook user can just send a personal
                    message, post an invitation on his/her timeline, or create an event and invite friends. Facebook is
                    also extensively used to interact with other people. Reconnecting with childhood friends and
                    former colleagues is also made easy: a user just needs to type the name of the person in the search
                    tab and then add that person as a friend.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    The second major function of Facebook is for academic purposes. It has several features
                    that can be used for teaching. For instance, teachers can simply update their statuses or send
                    messages to make announcements on submission deadlines and assignments. Facebook can also
                    be used as a venue for students to display their works, such as speaking performances and essays.
                    By sharing their outputs to others and receiving praise or constructive comments, students would
                    have a sense of authorship. Intellectual discussions can also be conducted on Facebook through its
                    chatting features.

                <p id="about">
                    Undoubtedly, Facebook is a viable tool for personal and academic success. Not only does

                    collaborate, communicate, and reconnect. Nevertheless, people should still be responsible enough

                    The Face of Quarantine <br>
                    By: E.R.D. Vins
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    March 13, 2020 marked the last day that students and teachers alike reported to school for
                    the school year 2019-2020. They were struck dumb with the declaration that they were not allowed
                    anymore to go back to school. This was because Pres. Rodrigo Roa Duterte announced that the
                    whole country would be put in a lockdown due to the threat of CoViD-19 (Corona Virus Disease).
                    Since a great number of people died from other countries because of this virus, lockdown was
                    implemented as a preventive measure. Thus, everyone was advised to stay at home as this was the
                    best way to beat the spread of the virus. Quarantine protocols became the best remedy of this health
                    crisis.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Due to this global health crisis, everything became different and economy was on its
                    lowest. Travels, businesses, leisure, and schooling were suddenly stopped because of this global
                    problem. However, there were sectors and establishments which were considered essentials such
                    as food industries, pharmacy, hospitals, banks, and grocery stores.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    At the grocery stores or banks, one could see that the guard is holding a thermal scanner.
                    Next to him was another personnel holding an alcohol or sanitizer. Outside the building, others
                    put a disinfectant spray for the whole body before entering the establishments. In front also of the
                    building, a signage of “NO HOME QUARANTINE PASS, NO ENTRY” was being posted and
                    below that note is another sign “NO FACE MASK, NO ENTRY.” Before people could enter an
                    establishment, they had to make a queue one meter away from each other to observe physical or
                    social distancing. Inside the establishments, one could see transparent plastic sheets. Above their
                    tables were bottles of alcohol or sanitizer for disinfection. Senior citizens and people below 20
                    years old were advised to stay at home as they were not allowed to go outside since they might be
                    easily infected with the virus. Inside the malls and drugstores, the shelves for disinfectants such as
                    alcohol, sanitizers, and vitamin C were empty. People were in panic buying storing for their foods.
                    This is the visage of lockdown, the face of quarantine that this generation cannot forget. It is as if
                    imprinted to the hearts and deep thoughts of every person around the world.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Quarantine protocols have been the practice, the new normal, or the lifestyle of this
                    generation because the enemy is unseen. Even if people are like birds in their cages staying at
                    home, they must obey these protocols. Who would have thought that this would happen to the
                    whole humanity? But if this is the best way to stop the spread of CoViD-19, then one has to follow
                    these measures.
