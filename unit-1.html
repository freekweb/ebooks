                <p id="about">
                    Learning to write is a sequential process. Output is important but with the goal of it in
                    mind, effective writing is considered quality writing. (Dagdag, et.al., 2010)
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    There are two main characteristics that must be present in writing a text: the content and
                    the form. It is said that “writing without form is like a human body without skeleton; writing without content is like a skeleton with no flesh.” (Mt. Edgecumbe 2)
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    According to Dagdag (2010), there are six steps in the writing process. These are the following:

                    <li>
                        <b>Pre-writing</b> – this is also called the invention or brainstorming stage. It is not easy coming up
                        with something to write. In this stage, you narrow your topic into the most important and
                        relevant. Ask yourself these things before getting to writing: “Why should you write about
                        this?” and “why should anyone read it?” You may come up with as many ideas as possible
                        within a given time frame. Some examples to take note in pre-writing are listing, fast writing,
                        spidering and mapping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Organizing</b> – this stage is vital in incorporating coherence in the transition of your writing.
                        After exhausting all possible ideas related to a topic, you may now focus in arranging these
                        ideas and thoughts into a sensible order.
                        <p id="about">
                            The writer creates their initial composition by writing down all their ideas in an organized way to convey a particular idea or present an argument. Audience and purpose need to be finalized.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>During-writing</b> – with a form in place and the content that would go with it, this is the stage where these ideas would be expressed in complete sentences and paragraphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Revising</b> – this is the stage where you polish the order of your ideas and filter the information
                        needed to get your point across. This is where you start to look for any mechanical errors and
                        correct them.
                        <p id="about">
                            The writer reviews, modifies, and reorganizes their work by rearranging, adding, or
                            deleting content, and by making the tone, style, and content appropriate for the intended
                            audience. The goal of this phase of the writing process is to improve the draft.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Editing</b> – the stage where writer proofreads and correct errors. He goes over the written work
                        nd checks it for basic errors in grammar and mechanics, and edit to improve style and clarity.
                        Having another writer’s feedback in this stage is helpful.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Writing the final draft</b> – after your work has gone through revisions, you would now have to
                        write your final draft, which you are ultimately content with. The final writing is shared with
                        the group. Sharing can be accomplished in a variety of ways, and with the help of computers, it can even be printed or published online. <br />

                            Additionally, the Writing Process according to Brown & Hood (1989) aims to answer the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul id="ul">
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Why you are writing <b>(purpose)</b>

                            On the other hand, Tiongson (2016), suggests that the purpose and the reason why you’re writing the paper must be clear to you so that you can also properly identify your target audience. Hence, the following must be answered:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                            It is hard to find a topic worth writing about. The following pre-writing strategies would help you in finding one. Tiongson (2016) added that in choosing a topic, you must select one that interests you or one that you are familiar with for you to have the motivation to start and elaborate on it.

                               <b> Brainstorming</b> – is also called listing. This is one of the most common methods of discovering
                                a topic. List down as much ideas as you can within a given amount of time. It is suggested to
                                start from general ideas and from there, write down all the possibilities. After listing all of
                                them down, make sure to pick the one that best suits your purpose or reason for writing. The
                                selection of topics may be broad but you may also find unlikely connections between each to
                                create another possible topic.

                                <b>Clustering</b> – is also called mind mapping or idea mapping. This is a technique in finding a
writing topic wherein you find the relationships between ideas. To start this method, you must
first put a subject forth and enclose it in a circle or underline it for emphasis. With that subject,
think of other ideas that would link to the single subject and connect them using lines.

                                <b>Freewriting</b> – the most unrestrained method in finding a suitable topic where you pour out all
your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. You can only
focus on a specific topic but you cannot edit all of these ideas. In this method, you have to
force yourself to keep on writing with a single focus as its purpose is to generate as many ideas
as you can without minding about technical errors such as in grammar and spelling. After
freewriting, you get to highlight the most outstanding and interesting ideas.
