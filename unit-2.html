                    The first questions a writer should ask himself is "Why am I writing?", "What am I going
                    to write", "What is my goal or my purpose for writing?", and "How will I start writing?". For many
                    writing contexts, your immediate purpose may be to complete an assignment or to get a good
                    grade. But the long-range factors to consider like purpose in writing, audience in writing, and
                    topics in writing fall under one essential component of a any written output, which is content. In
                    order to communicate successfully to your audience and to better deliver the intended purpose and
                    message, building and effective contet for writing will make you a better writer.

                <p id="about">
                    <b>Content/Ideas</b> in writing refers to the development of a clear, meaningful, and substantial
                    ideas in a writing task. It involves a purpose in writing, the interpretation of relevant and varied
                    ideas to the topic being discussed, and the accuracy of details present in a written output.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Imagine reading one long block of text, with each idea blurring into the next because clarity
                    is not emphasized, most probably, you can't focus easily and you can't follow all points being
                    discussed. Even if you are reading a thrilling novel or an interesting news article, you will likely
                    lose interest in what the author has to say very quickly. Same with writing, if there is no clear and
                    concise content or ideas, you will rend to lose focus in making your points understandable.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Hence, it is impotant to understand these three elements of content in writing:

            <div class="col s12">

                <p id="about">
                    The combination of these three: purpose, audience, and tone, dictate what the paragraph
                    covers and how it will support one main point.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    “Audience” is the intended readers of your paper. This can be a relative, a friend or a
                    colleague. Usually in academic setting, your audience can be your classmates, teachers, professors
                    and other students. = In every case, thinking about who will read the paper changes what you write
                    and how you write it. Ask yourself some questions about your audience. Who will read this paper?
                    How much do they already know about the topic, and what do you need to tell them? Why will
                    your audience read what you write, and can you make them want to keep reading? How are they
                    likely to react to what you are saying? The answers to each of these questions will affect both the
                    content and the form of your writing.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Other element is the “Purpose” referring to your reasons inwriting, and what effect you
                    hope to have. The most common purpose in writing is to explain an idea, a concept or a an object.
                    Sometimes, this purpose may want to persuade or inlfunce readers and their thinking about an idea
                    or a concept.. In doing so, you may need to describe an object, place, or activity. Other times, you
                    may choose to narrate set of events, in the manner of a story. Furthermore, some may want
                    to express feelings, to explore an idea or perhaps entertain or amuse listeners or readers,
                    to inform people or explain an idea, to argue for or against an idea in order to persuade others to
                    believe or act in a certain way, and to mediate or negotiate a solution in a tense or difficult
                    situation.

                <p id="about">
                    <b>“Tone”</b>, on the other hand, is a more complex term. It describes the feeling of your writing;
                    in other words, the formality or informality of your writing. This connects the intensity of your
                    own experiences, to your objectives, and the attitude or position you hold towards your subject.
                    Audience and purpose have a large effect on tone. Most academic writing is formal and usually
                    objective in tone, though in some fields – especially in the humanities and some social sciences –
                    subjectivity is valued.

                <p id="about">
                    Getting back to the writing process examined in the previous unit, we can say that all
                    written communication, <i><b>general purpose</b></i> is considered as the end-goal of a written
                    communication. Writing with a real and clear purpose draws the writer to the desire of connecting,
                    communicating and influencing the world.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Can you remember a time when you were asked to complete a task in which you could not
                    see and make any relevance to the subject? Being under this situation is, indeedn, infuriating and
                    draining. It drains all energy from useless thinking. In contrast, the energy that comes from setting
                    meaningful and purposeful task is fulfilling. Therefore, another factor to consider in building a
                    content is the relevance to the subject being discusses. Relevance is an all-important feature of
                    good essays and written papers. It is very important that all parts of an essay are directly related
                    to the subject. Any parts which wander away from the subject concerned will weaken its
                    effectiveness. Consequently, it will destroy the accuracy of the content.

                <p id="about">
                    Brainstorming is an informal way of generating topics to write about, as well as formulating
                    the points you can make about your topic. It can be done at any point in a writing process. The
                    crucial point about brainstorming is that there should be no pressure to be brilliant. You should
                    open your mind to whatever that pops into it.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    Brainstorming helps you generate topics and narrow them down to a few important ideas.
                    It improves your creative thinking skills and deepens your understanding of a possible topic.
                </p>
                <p id="about">
                    The effectiveness of brainstorming is that one idea can trigger another idea in an
                    unrestrained manner. Creative thinkers must allow themselves to think the trivial and the
                    impossible for the purpose of brainstorming is to bring about this kind of freethinking.

                            This is appropriate for textual people or those who are more comfortable in processing
                            words than visuals. Involves writing the main topic and listing down the related ideas. Don’t
                            outline at this point. Outlining stalls the creative act of brainstorming by requiring you to evaluate
                            and organize your thoughts. Remember, brainstorming should be an uninhibited activity.

                            not pause in order to spell correctly or write flawlessly, and don’t go back to rewrite. Turn off your
                            inner editor. Do not strive for coherence. Just write. Consider closing your eyes while you’re
                            writing or typing, or turn the computer monitor off. Just write.
